    We have two lists, ‘first’ and ‘second'. Write a function that returns the intersection of these lists.
That is, return a list with the elements that are in both. If there are no common elements, return an empty list.

Examples with correct outputs:

intersection([1, 2, 3], [9, 3, 4]) → [3]

intersection([10, 35, 14], [90, 35, 10, 14, 28]) → [10, 35, 14]

intersection([100, 25, 134, 2, 4], [4, 2]) → [4, 2]

intersection([10, 35, 14], []) → []

intersection([10, 35, 14], [1, 2, 3]) → []
